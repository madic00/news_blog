The answer to eco-friendly journeys when you’d rather avoid public transport and don’t have the time (or inclination) to walk, an electric scooter is emission-free, relatively safe and a far cheaper alternative to an electric car. Because it turns out that “Four legs good, two legs bad” is not only a famous literary quote but also the reaction once you’ve tried out an electric scooter for the first time. Replace those extra two legs with two motor-powered, high-speed wheels and you’ve found yourself the perfect commuting companion or quick-spin-around-the-block assistant. 1	Unagi	Best overall. 2   Apollo  Best high end. 3	Xiaomi	Best value",

Ask the universe for what you desire, and hopefully you’ll receive it. But what if manifesting is actually a physical skill in disguise? Other mental skills, including reading, writing, speaking, and solving math problems, are actually physical skills too. Your physical brain implements these skills on your neural hardware. If your brain is damaged in certain ways, you could lose some of your mental skills. This is one of many factors that’s motivating me to test eating raw for all of 2021. This month I’m reloading those skills, practicing making different raw meals to get back into the flow of eating raw while still permitting cooked food when desired for the next few weeks. I want to do a deeper dive into this aspect of life, especially with respect to what I can glean about reality’s responses. I recently reviewed some of my old blog posts that I wrote during the time when I was eating fully or mostly raw (about 11-12 years ago), and I was struck by how easily I manifested various desires back then.",

Nikola Jokic, who finished the season with absurd averages of 26.4 points, 10.8 rebounds, 8.3 assists, 1.3 steals and 1.3 threes, was in the conversation for MVP all season. And while there were pushes for Joel Embiid, Stephen Curry, James Harden, Damian Lillard and even Chris Paul, the Denver Nuggets' Serbian point center was officially announced as the MVP on Tuesday. He was well above average in two-point percentage, three-point percentage and free-throw percentage. He trailed only Curry in 'the number of extra points added by True Shot Attempts made above league average.' The NBA is as talent-rich as it's ever been. And Jokic is its Most Valuable Player.",
